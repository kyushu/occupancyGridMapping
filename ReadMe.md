This project is used to demonstrate Occupancy Grid Mapping and display the map and it is part of Robotics Software Nano degree course,

The robot equipped with eight sonar rangefinder sensors circulates in 
    an environment to map it. This robot is provided with its exact 
    poses at each timestamp.

measurement.txt : The measurements from the sonar rangefinder sensors 
                    attached to the robot at each time stamp recorded 
                    over a period of 413 seconds. (timestamp, measurement 1-8).

poses.txt       : The exact robot poses at each timestamp recorded over 
                    a period of 413 seconds. (timestamp, x, y, Ï´).
